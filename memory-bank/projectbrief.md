# Flappy Bird Recreation Project Brief

## üéØ Project Overview
Recreate the classic Flappy Bird game using modern web technologies with an AI-first development approach. The goal is to build a complete, polished game that matches the original's addictive gameplay while showcasing modern web development practices.

## üõ†Ô∏è Tech Stack
- **Framework:** Next.js 14+ (App Router)
- **Language:** TypeScript
- **Styling:** Tailwind CSS
- **Game Rendering:** HTML5 Canvas API
- **State Management:** Zustand
- **Sound:** Web Audio API (programmatic generation)
- **IDE:** Cursor with Claude 4 Opus
- **Version Control:** Git & GitHub
- **Deployment:** Vercel

## üìã Core Requirements
1. **Gameplay Mechanics**
   - Bird physics with gravity and flap mechanics
   - Pipe obstacles with collision detection
   - Scoring system with high score persistence
   - Smooth 60 FPS performance

2. **Visual Design**
   - Parallax scrolling backgrounds
   - Animated sprites and smooth transitions
   - Professional UI with game states (start, playing, game over, pause)
   - Responsive design for desktop and mobile

3. **Audio Experience**
   - Programmatically generated sound effects
   - Volume controls and audio settings
   - Sound feedback for all interactions

4. **User Experience**
   - Intuitive controls (click, touch, spacebar)
   - Multiple game states with smooth transitions
   - High score tracking and achievement system
   - Accessibility considerations

## üéÆ Game Mechanics
- **Bird Control:** Single input (click/tap/spacebar) to flap
- **Physics:** Gravity constantly pulls bird down, flaps provide upward impulse
- **Obstacles:** Pipes with gaps that scroll horizontally
- **Scoring:** Points awarded for passing through pipe gaps
- **Difficulty:** Consistent pipe spacing with randomized gap positions

## üì± Platform Support
- Desktop browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge)
- Mobile browsers with touch controls
- PWA capabilities for installation

## üéØ Success Criteria
- Stable 60 FPS performance
- Responsive controls (<100ms input lag)
- Cross-browser compatibility
- Clean, maintainable codebase
- Comprehensive documentation
- Successful deployment to production

## üìà Development Approach
Following a 33-step roadmap with iterative development, extensive use of Claude 4 Opus for code generation, and continuous testing and refinement.
